// cracking the coding interview(fourth edition): 4.7 subtree checking
// You have two very large trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and T2, with hundreds of nodes.
// Create an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1


// My approach -- pre-order traversal
// Controversial point -- Time O(log n + log m)
